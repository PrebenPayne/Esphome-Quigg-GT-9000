# Home Assistant, Esphome, Quigg-GT-9000 remote control

This YAML code is to simulate remote control QUIGG GT-9000, using a cheap 433.92MHz transmitter. It can be used in Home Assistant with an ESP8266 or ESP32 device.

I have recorded the transmit codes for each button directly from the remote control HW IO-pin inside the remote control
